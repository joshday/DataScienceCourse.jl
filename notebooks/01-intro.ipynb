    "# What is Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **data science** is a relatively new term used to describe a variety of cross-discipline tasks that cover statistics, mathematics, computer science, data visualization, and information science.  Because of the wide variety of tasks involved, the role of a \"data scientist\" may differ greatly between organizations.  At a high level, data science is the collection of activities that help one move upword in the [DIKW Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid), shown below:\n",

    "**How do we get from data to knowledge/wisdom?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Movement up the pyramid happens in incremental steps.  Sometimes you'll have an \"aha!\" moment and make a leap in understanding, but that is typically due to the previous information you've gathered.  To aid with the task of incremental knowledge-building, the data science workflow is made up of the following steps:\n",
