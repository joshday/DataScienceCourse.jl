# DataScienceCourse

This repo contains the materials for the "Primer on Data Science" course on Julia Academy.  Use this as a template for creating your own courses.

## Notes

- Run `bash cleanup.sh` before you commit notebooks to git to avoid bloat.  Alternatively, use [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl) to build your notebooks in a `deps/build.jl` script.
- Your course module (in this case `DataScienceCourse`) can contain bonus course materials like larger examples.
